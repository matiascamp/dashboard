  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `user` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `createdAt` on the `user` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `name` on the `user` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `password` on the `user` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `updatedAt` on the `user` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to alter the column `role` on the `user` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Enum(EnumId(0))` to `VarChar(191)`.
  - Added the required column `passwordHash` to the `User` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
